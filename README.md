Welcome! Our growing system is a project for growing large amounts of high-quality crops. However, it is also an excellent all-purpose playground for botany.

It is currently in the early-to-mid prototyping stage and is currently undergoing intensive shakedown testing in order to ascertain its long-term safety. This repository has been created as a holding pool for all relevant information relevant, including but not limited to: computer code, build and operation instructions, CAD files, bills of material, component datasheets, third-party research, and safety warnings.

A good part of the reason we are setting this up is in preparation for our prototype's refinement into a finished product as part of our CS476 project at University of Regina. It is intended for our team to work in and also to showcase both the figurative and literal fruits of our labour.
