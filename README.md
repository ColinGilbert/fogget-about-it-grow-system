Welcome!


The "Fogget-about-it" growing system is a project for growing large amounts of high-quality crops. It uses fogponics and water recapture, in preparation for a freshwater-scarce, electricity-cheap future. It is also an excellent all-purpose playground for botany.

As part of the capstone (CS476) project at University of Regina, we are creating a management system for multiple such growrooms. It is intended mostly as a working repository, but also to showcase both the figurative and literal fruits of our labours.

The prototype physical platform. It is currently in the early-to-mid prototyping stage and is currently undergoing intensive shakedown testing in order to ascertain its long-term safety. We are doing all this to transform our prototypes into a proper finished product. This repository will also serve as a staging area for all relevant information, including but not limited to: computer code, build and operation instructions, CAD files, BOMs, component datasheets, third-party research, and safety warnings.
